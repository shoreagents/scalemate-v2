# Railway Deployment with Custom Docker

## What Changed

I've switched your Railway deployment from Nixpacks to a **custom Dockerfile** to completely avoid the cache mounting conflicts that were causing the EBUSY errors.

### Key Changes:

1. **Custom Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with optimized caching
2. **Next.js Standalone**: Enabled standalone output for smaller, faster containers
3. **No Cache Conflicts**: Removed all problematic cache mounting
4. **Railway Config**: Updated to use DOCKERFILE builder

## Files Modified:

- `Dockerfile` - Custom multi-stage Docker build
- `next.config.js` - Added standalone output mode
- `railway.json` - Changed to use Dockerfile builder
- `nixpacks.toml` - Still present but not used (can be removed)

## Expected Build Process:

1. **Stage 1 (deps)**: Install production dependencies only
2. **Stage 2 (builder)**: Full install + build the application
3. **Stage 3 (runner)**: Copy built app to minimal runtime image

## Deploy Steps:

1. **Commit and push** all the changes to your repository
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** using the new Dockerfile
3. **Build should complete** without cache errors
4. **First deploy** may take 3-5 minutes due to new build process

## After Successful Deployment:

```bash
# Run the database setup script once
node scripts/setup-production.js
```

## Troubleshooting:

- **Build fails**: Check Railway logs for specific Docker errors
- **Database errors**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in Railway environment
- **App doesn't start**: Check that standalone mode is working correctly

## Benefits of Custom Dockerfile:

- ✅ No cache mounting conflicts
- ✅ Smaller production image (~200MB vs ~1GB)
- ✅ Faster startup times
- ✅ Better layer caching
- ✅ More predictable builds

## Environment Variables Needed:

- `DATABASE_URL` (set by Railway Postgres add-on)
- `NODE_ENV=production` (automatically set)

The deployment should now work without the EBUSY cache errors!
